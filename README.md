# XBOX2PC

This is a project that allows you to RUN Xbox One OS (CodeName:Durango) on a computer!

## Usage instructions
1. Download the ISO
2. Deploy it into an pendrive, [Rufus](Rufus.ie) recommended
3. Boot at the pendrive
4. Wait Xbox OS Load
5. Connect an usb controller
6. Complete the setup

## Theory that it will work
"A LinkedIn page from a Microsoft intern contains a reference to something called "Windows OneCore" which could be a rebranding of the company's plans to develop one kernel that will be used for all of Microsoft's operating systems, including Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox."

So if it uses the same kernel for all devices, in _*theory*_ this will work
[I got this info Here!](https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-onecore-shows-some-microsoft-linkedin-pages#:~:text=A%20LinkedIn%20page%20from%20a%20Microsoft%20intern%20contains,operating%20systems%2C%20including%20Windows%2C%20Windows%20Phone%20and%20Xbox.)

## Problems that might be serious
1. Drivers: These drivers are designed for AMD "Jargon", when this is done i will thest W10 drivers.
2. Boot the system: Xbox One might use a UEFI Bootloader, Legacy users might have problems booting the system

## Requeriments
1. 8GB Ram (Minimum)
2. AMD Motherboard (Recommended)
